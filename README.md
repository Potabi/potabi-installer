# potabi-installer
A custom, webkit-UI based installation tool for Potabi Systems.
Inspired by a variety of installers like GBI (GhostBSD Installer),
the elementaryOS installer, and the Pop!_OS installer.

Borrows code from PC-SYSINSTALL to get some of the more complicated
functionality dealt with for early beta versions. Specifically, the
GhostBSD fork of PC-SYSINSTALL. 

This program does not use PC-SYSINSTALL by itself but rather only
speicific scripts
